# Changelog

## 1.0-alpha-1.7

	- Removed `Perk: True` from the plugin header to address potential PHP errors.

## 1.0-alpha-1.6

	- Added new `raw` modifier that can be used in the feed merge tags. This allows for fetching specific properties from the OpenAI response. Example usage: `{:1:openai_feed_2,raw[usage/total_tokens]}`

## 1.0-alpha-1.5

	- Updated feed merge tags to evaluate feed conditional logic (if configured) before returning a result. If the conditional logic does not evaluate as truthy, an empty string is returned.
	- Updated secret key setting to be a masked input.

	- Added new `gf_openai_request_body` PHP filter for customizing requests that go to OpenAI.

## 1.0-alpha-1.3

	- Added kses/strip_all_tags (depending on if field is using rich text editor) to `maybe_save_result_to_field()`.

	- Added conditional logic for feeds.

## 1.0-alpha-1.2
